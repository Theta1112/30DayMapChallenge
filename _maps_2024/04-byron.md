In Singapore, public housing is so iconic, even [the queen](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/highlights-of-queen-elizabeths-three-visits-to-singapore) has visited those. My home is a public housing unit, and for today's hexagon map I have chosen to explore which parts of Singapore has the highest proportion of public housing, whose estates tend to have much better neighbourhood amenities than private ones.

It is reassuring that Singapore maintains the separation of public / private housing markets, with careful restrictions on foreign investment. Without such a system, our dear friends at the nearby Huntsman Hall would have realised tremendous gains from transacting land and properties in Singapore.
