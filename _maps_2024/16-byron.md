Singapore is a wealthy country, but not everyone is well-off. To ensure equitable access to healthcare, the Ministry of Health runs a subsidised primary care system with General Practitioners enrolling into the [Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS)](https://www.moh.gov.sg/managing-expenses/schemes-and-subsidies/chas), offering low-cost medical services.

This map explores the distribution of such subsidised clinics across planning areas, using senior population weights. This might be a starting point for policymakers to improve coverage at lower-density areas, particularly as Singapore ages.
