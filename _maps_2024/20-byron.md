The [QuickOSM plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QuickOSM/) is a powerful source of spatial data, housing everything from restaurants, railways and ... embassies. 

Day 20's map visualises all of the embassies, consulates and high commissions in Singapore, all of which are located in the Central region. MRT lines are added as an additional reference. Statistical methods such as Ripley's K function might be useful if one desires to see the extent to which these points are clustered or dispersed, but given the workload of five courses, the present map shall suffice.
