This map shows the extent of the 17 reservoirs in Singapore. But why isn't water coloured blue in this map?

At our current trajectory of development, the human race is on the brink of an ecological crisis, with our consumption of Earth's resources - water included - exceeding their natural replacement rates. Indeed, Singapore is one of the world's most water-stressed countries. And I fear that it will in our generation where once again, the taps run dry.
